# Hi - I'm Deepika Reddygari 👋
**Data Engineer | MS Data Science @ GWU (GPA 3.9) | Washington, DC**

I design and build robust data pipelines and warehousing solutions that transform raw data into actionable insights. With 2+ years of hands-on experience in ETL, data modeling, and real-time processing, I've optimized workflows to reduce latency by 30% and ensured data accuracy across enterprise systems.

## About Me
I'm a data engineer passionate about building efficient, scalable data infrastructure. Starting my career at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I developed expertise in SQL, ETL pipeline design, and data warehousing using Star Schema. Now, I'm leveraging Python, PySpark, and advanced analytics to solve complex data challenges at scale.
