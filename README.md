# Hi - I’m Deepika Reddygari 👋
**MS Data Science @ GWU (GPA 3.9) · B.Tech Mechanical Engineering**

I build small-world prototypes and big-picture models for cleaner energy — from lab-scale phase-change modules to data-driven system analyses that help planners understand how thermal storage changes reliability, cost, and emissions.

## My short story
I began as a mechanical engineer fascinated by heat. While building a PCM module that recovered diesel-exhaust heat, I discovered how much *data* changes what we can learn from experiments. Now I blend hands-on fabrication with Python modeling and ML to make thermal energy storage (TES) meaningful at grid scale.
